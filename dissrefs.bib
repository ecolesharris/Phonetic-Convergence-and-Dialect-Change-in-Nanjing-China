	Abstract = {It is often supposed that dialect contact and dialect mixture were involved in the development of new colonial varieties of European languages, such as Brazilian Portuguese, Canadian French, and Australian English. However, while no one has denied that dialect contact took place, the role of dialect mixture has been disputed. Among those who do not accept a role for it, some have also considered the role of identity, especially new national identities, to be self-evident. This article argues for the role of dialect mixture and against the role of identity. It presents case studies from pre-16th-century colonial expansions of European languages, an era when any role for national identities would be very hard to argue for. Instead, it suggests that dialect mixture is the inevitable result of dialect contact, and that the mechanism which accounts for this is quasi-automatic accommodation in face-to-face interaction.},
	Annote = {Trudgill explicitly rejects the idea that identity (and social distance?) have anything to do with dialect formation, and proposes--following Cappella (1997), Labov (2001), and others--that it's actually a "mechanical and inevitable" process based in a biologically programmed need to imitate.

Again, it's pretty clear that there are biological processes at work in processes of imitation, but to completely discount the social on the basis that *in the case of colonial Englishes* there probably wasn't any influence from *national* identity seems silly to me. It's gotta be a little bit of both, no?},

	Abstract = {Imitation of shadowed words was evaluated using Goldinger's (1998) AXB paradigm. The first experiment was a replication of Goldinger's experiments with different tokens. Experiment 1's AXB tests showed that shadowed words were judged to be better imitations of target words than were baseline (read) counterparts more often than chance (.50). Order of presentation of baseline and shadowed words in the AXB test also significantly influenced judgments. Degree of prior exposure to token words did not significantly influence judgments of imitation. Experiment 2 employed modified target tokens with extended voice onset times (VOTs). In addition to AXB tests, VOTs of response tokens were compared across baseline and shadowing conditions. The AXB tests revealed shadowed words to be better imitations of target tokens than baseline, without an influence of AXB presentation order. Differences between baseline and shadowing VOTs were greater when VOTs were extended. The implications of spontaneous imitation in nonsocial settings are considered.},

@article{babel2012evidence,
	Abstract = {Spontaneous phonetic imitation is the process by which a talker comes to be more similar-sounding to a model talker as the result of exposure. The current experiment investigates this phenomenon, examining whether vowel spectra are automatically imitated in a lexical shadowing task and how social liking affects imitation. Participants were assigned to either a Black talker or White talker; within this talker manipulation, participants were either put into a condition with a digital image of their assigned model talker or one without an image. Liking was measured through attractiveness rating. Participants accommodated toward vowels selectively; the low vowels /{\ae} ɑ/ showed the strongest effects of imitation compared to the vowels /i o u/, but the degree of this trend varied across conditions. In addition to these findings of phonetic selectivity, the degree to which these vowels were imitated was subtly affected by attractiveness ratings and this also interacted with the experimental condition. The results demonstrate the labile nature of linguistic segments with respect to both their perceptual encoding and their variation in production.},
	Annote = {The author frames phonetic convergence as motivated by the tendency to align socially with people you like, but also test the automaticity of phonetic imitation. Babel's one of the best I've come across so far at integrating these two sides of the literature.

She cites Trudgill (2008) to say that imitation is a potential cause of dialect formation, but remains agnostic (at least in *this* context) as to whether it's totally automatic or socially motivated. (The citation is in a section that mostly seems to cite automaticity supporters.)

I need to read this one more closely, but it looks like it will probably be useful.},

When instructions oblige highly associated categories (e.g., flower + pleasant) to share a response key, performance is faster than when less associated categories (e.g., insect + pleasant) share a key. This performance difference implicitly measures differential association of the 2 concepts with the attribute. In 3 experiments, the IAT was sensitive to (a) near-universal evaluative differences (e.g., flower vs. insect), (b) expected individual differences in evaluative associations (Japanese + pleasant vs. Korean + pleasant for Japanese vs. Korean subjects), and (c) consciously disavowed evaluative differences (Black + pleasant vs. White + pleasant for self-described unprejudiced White subjects).

As in Figure 1, the line with filled squares as data points should be labeled MEAN, the line with filled diamonds as data points should be labeled MEDIAN, and the line with unfilled squares as data points should be labeled RECIPROCAL.{$]$} In reporting Implicit Association Test (IAT) results, researchers have most often used scoring conventions described in the first publication of the IAT (A. G. Greenwald, D. E. McGhee, \& J. L. K. Schwartz, 1998). Demonstration IATs available on the Internet have produced large data sets that were used in the current article to evaluate alternative scoring procedures. Candidate new algorithms were examined in terms of their (a) correlations with parallel self-report measures, (b) resistance to an artifact associated with speed of responding, (c) internal consistency, (d) sensitivity to known influences on IAT measures, and (e) resistance to known procedural influences. The best-performing measure incorporates data from the IAT's practice trials, uses a metric that is calibrated by each respondent's latency variability, and includes a latency penalty for errors. This new algorithm strongly outperforms the earlier (conventional) procedure. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

	Abstract = {One of the central issues in the theory of speech community is whether speech community is a naturally-existing entity or a research construct without any restricted empirical basis. The issue is attacked here by way of a language survey. The survey was on language-choice behavior in public places, conducted in the city of Nanjing in 2002. The survey results show: (a) Nanjing residents' verbal behavior exhibits a specific order of social convention and the urban population thus makes up an effective body of social communication. (b) The ordered behavior reflects a community-wide evaluative system that governs linguistic heterogeneity. (c) The thinning-out of the regularity among the individuals' behaviors is typically found both in the spatial and the temporal marginals of the urban population. The study supports the hypothesis that a speech community is a naturally-existing entity. An attitudinal-behavioral and impactal unity is the core of such existence. With the approach taken her},

@article{delvaux2007influence,
	Annote = {``[{\ldots}]the general framework of this research is the hypothesis that sound change partly originates in mutual and unintentional imitation between interacting speakers (Demolin et al., 2003). The idea that imitation plays a central role in sound change can be traced back to the end of the nineteenth century (e.g. Sievers, 1901). Our main claim is that interacting speakers imitate each other's speech, so that not only are individual phonetic realisations modified, but mental (phonetic) representations are also. We think that this mechanism, occurring at the (inter)individual level, may account for two apparently paradoxical features of the system: (i) the stability of phonetic realisations within a speech community, and (ii) their potential for sound change. Indeed, if speakers mutually imitate the productions they are confronted with, there is a wide range of potential variation in the individual phonetic realisations of phonological representations. Actually, a large amount of individual phonetic variation occurs in spontaneous speech and is unaccounted for in most theories of phonetic implementation. We propose that, unless hindered by higher-order socio-psychological factors (e.g. deliberate will to dissociate from a particular social group, or to distance oneself from a specific individual), speakers automatically tend to adjust their phonetic realisations to ambient speech. When speakers are interacting, their speech productions automatically tend to converge on the acoustic-phonetic level. The resulting phonetic variant is a hybrid realisation which is achieved by consensus among interlocutors. On the community level, the accumulation of such consensuses results in the particular set of speech habits, allophones, and control regimes that characterise the particular way of speaking of the speech community. The consensuses about phonetic realisations are constantly renewed, the corresponding mental representations are updated, and this on-going process is one of the starting points of sound change. Indeed, sound change occurs when there is an agreement within a speech community to use a phonetic variant different from the one used previously.'' (pp. 3-4)

``Among others, Trudgill (1985, 1986) used accommodation theory to account for change in social and regional dialects in contact. Individual short-term accommodation may become a long-term accommodation that may in turn spread throughout the community at large.'' (pp. 6)

They distinguish between imitation and mimesis. Mimesis apparently leaves traces in long-term memory, and can be used to modify production of things not being directly imitated (I think).

I need to figure out what Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients are, and whether I should be using them to tell the difference between MSM and ND speakers. Maybe mergement would be more visible that way.

``During the Post-test, the speakers came back towards their own pronunciation, but usually not completely. It all depended on the speaker.'' (pp. 25) This is interesting, because it sort of points at long-term convergence effects, but emphasizes the variability of the speaker. Maybe it would be interesting to try to figure out what contributes to that variability.

``One major achievement was made through Experiment 2: it showed that imitation is not a stimulus-response behaviour involving short-term memory only. It is accompanied by some changes in representations affecting long-term memory. In other words, imitation and/or mimesis are involved in the process of phonetically implementing phonological representations.'' (pp. 27)

They suggest that future research should look into the time-depth and acoustic limits of mimesis.

I don't really get their explanations, but the idea that sound change could come from imitation/mimesis makes sense given the persistence of these effects into the post-test condition. They point out that greater amounts of exposure (like over months or years of living around speakers of another variety) should have a greater effect than the few hundred repetitions of vowels they heard in this experiment.},

@article{babel2010dialect,
	Annote = {Social biases influenced accomodation more than immediate social context (being insulted or complimented). This is pretty interesting, because it seems to me to speak to automaticity of imitation on a social--not just phonetic--level.

I don't think, though, that the author would agree with me. They say "While a talker is crafting from a stylistic repertoire that heeds the needs of the audience, a speaker feels the pressure to maintain a level of faithfulness to their social network and larger social affiliations" (pp. 439). I just don't think that in the context of this experiment you can say that because these NZers have pro-Australia biases that there's necessarily a "social network" there to exert any pressure.

If you could say for certain, however, that a social network did exist, I could see how this sort of pressure be a source of resistance to society-level sound change, at least for one group of people. (See Trudgill 2008 for case studies that argue it couldn't really.)},
